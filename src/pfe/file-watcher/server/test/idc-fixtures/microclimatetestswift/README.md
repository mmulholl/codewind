## Scaffolded Swift Kitura server application

This scaffolded application provides a starting point for creating Swift applications running on [Kitura](http://www.kitura.io/).

#### Project contents
This application has been generated with the following capabilities and services, which are described in full in their respective sections below:

* [Embedded metrics dashboard](#embedded-metrics-dashboard)
* [Docker files](#docker-files)
* [Iterative Development](#iterative-development)

### Requirements
* [Swift 4](https://swift.org/download/)

### Run
To build and run the application:
1. `swift build`
2. `.build/debug/microclimatetestswift`

#### Docker
A description of the files related to Docker can be found in the [Docker files](#docker-files) setion. To build the two docker images, run the following commands from the root directory of the project:
* `docker build -t myapp-run .`
* `docker build -t myapp-build -f Dockerfile-tools .`
You may customize the names of these images by specifying a different value after the `-t` option.

To compile the application using the tools docker image, run:
* `docker run -v $PWD:/swift-project -w /swift-project myapp-build /swift-utils/tools-utils.sh build release`

To run the application:
* `docker run -it -p 8080:8080 -v $PWD:/swift-project -w /swift-project myapp-run sh -c .build-ubuntu/release/microclimatetestswift`


#### Kubernetes
To deploy your application to your Kubernetes cluster, run `helm install --name myapp .` in the `/chart/microclimatetestswift` directory. You need to make sure you change the `repository` variable in your `chart/microclimatetestswift/values.yaml` file points to the docker image containing your runnable application.

### Configuration
#### Iterative Development
The `iterative-dev.sh` script is included in the root of the generated Swift project and allows for fast & easy iterations for the developer. Instead of stopping the running Kitura server to see new code changes, while the script is running, it will automatically detect changes in the project's **.swift** files and recompile the app accordingly.

To use iterative development:
* For native OS, execute the `./iterative-dev.sh` script from the root of the project.
* With docker, shell into the tools container mentioned above, and run the `./swift-project/iterative-dev.sh` script.  File system changes are detected using a low-tech infinitely looping poll mechanism, which works in both local OS/filesystem and across host OS->Docker container volume scenarios.


### Service descriptions
#### Embedded metrics dashboard
This application uses the [SwiftMetrics package](https://github.com/RuntimeTools/SwiftMetrics) to gather application and system metrics.

These metrics can be viewed in an embedded dashboard on `/swiftmetrics-dash`. The dashboard displays various system and application metrics, including CPU, memory usage, HTTP response metrics and more.
#### Docker files
The application includes the following files for Docker support:
* `.dockerignore`
* `Dockerfile`
* `Dockerfile-tools`

The `.dockerignore` file contains the files/directories that should not be included in the built docker image. By default this file contains the `Dockerfile` and `Dockerfile-tools`. It can be modified as required.

The `Dockerfile` defines the specification of the default docker image for running the application. This image can be used to run the application.

The `Dockerfile-tools` is a docker specification file similar to the `Dockerfile`, except it includes the tools required for compiling the application. This image can be used to compile the application.

Details on how to build the docker images, compile and run the application within the docker image can be found in the [Run section](#run).
